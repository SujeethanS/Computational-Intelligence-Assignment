**House Price Prediction Random Forest Full Model**
This repository contains a full implementation of a house price prediction model using the Random Forest algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of house features and corresponding prices, and it can be used to predict the price of a new house based on its features.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository. However, you can obtain a similar dataset from various sources, such as real estate websites or public datasets. The dataset should include features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, etc., along with the corresponding prices.

**Dependencies**
To run the model, you will need the following dependencies:
  * Python 3.x
  * scikit-learn
  * pandas
  * numpy
