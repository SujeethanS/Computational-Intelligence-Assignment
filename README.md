# House Price Prediction Random Forest Full Model

This repository contains a full implementation of a house price prediction model using the Random Forest algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of house features and corresponding prices, and it can be used to predict the price of a new house based on its features.

# Kaggle House Price Prediction Random Forest Full Model

This repository contains a full implementation of a house price prediction model using the Random Forest algorithm for the Kaggle House Price Prediction competition. The model is trained on a dataset of house features and corresponding prices, and it can be used to predict the price of a new house based on its features.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository. However, you can obtain a similar dataset from various sources, such as real estate websites or public datasets. The dataset should include features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, etc., along with the corresponding prices.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository. However, you can obtain the dataset from the Kaggle competition page: Kaggle House Price Prediction. Download the dataset files (train.csv and test.csv) and place them in the data directory.

# Dependencies

To run the model, you will need the following dependencies:
  * Python 3.x
  * scikit-learn
  * pandas
  * numpy

You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy

Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/SujeethanS/Computational-Intelligence-Assignment.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd house-price-prediction-random-forest

Prepare your dataset:
Place your dataset file in the project directory.

Update the file path in the train_model.py file to point to your dataset.
Train the model:
python train_model.py

This will train the random forest model on your dataset and save the trained model to a file named model.pkl.
Predict house prices:
Update the file path in the predict.py file to point to your trained model (model.pkl).
Update the input features in the predict.py file to match the features of the house you want to predict the price for.

Run the prediction script:
python predict.py

This will load the trained model and predict the price of the house based on the input features.
